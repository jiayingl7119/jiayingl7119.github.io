            <h1 class="margin text-center">Web Page Project </h1>
            <h2> Context</h2>
            <p>After learning the basics of HTML, and CSS, I was assigned a partner project to make a webpage. Specifically one that was about "Making a Movie". During this project, there was a lot of creativity put into it. No restrictions. At least not much. But, there was a lot of creative ideas and decision-making involved. In me and my partner's case, we decided to make it a mix of Halloween and Christmas.</p>
            <h2> Content</h2>
            <p> As stated beforehand, we used HTML and CSS in our projects. This included spans, divs, color, borders, fonts, and more. For the HTML part, there had to be headings, paragraphs, images, margins, and padding. This is the general layout of the webpage. For the CSS part of this project, it includes color, font size, image size, border, border color, and more. The images (that were required to use) in our projects had to be our own or found on google that were legal to use. This was all included in the planning page which was used all throughout the project. We also added more ideas in that planning when we did have new ideas.</p>
            <h2> Challenges </h2>
            <p> The personal challenges I had was trying to figure out what looked good where. The padding and margins were tricky. Not to mention the picture size and importing. This was hard because sometimes the coding was wrong and would not work. To add on, ther whole formatting was off and wouldn't look good at a certain point.</p>
            <p> Another challenge I had was doing most of the work for my project. Since I was doing most of the coding, I was obviously going to do more of the work. However, my teammate barely did anything of the cosemetics when the deadline was almost there. Which I had to improvise and change some stuff. This included adding a lot to the CSS. I consulted with my teammate and figured out how to do the rest of the cosemetics. But it was stressful since I was doing so much of the work.</p>
            <h2> Takeaways</h2>
            <p> One of things I am taught by this project is to trust the process. The reason why is because for one, the first things that were added did not look well. But working through it, it started looking better and better. Until it finally reaches to the point of where it looked like the final product. There were a few tweaks here and there. But in the end, it looked great. Better than how it was when it was first started. </p>
            <h2> Next Steps</h2>
            <p> I plan on working on more projects more by myself than with others. The reason being that I can't really trust anyone because they end up doing things last minute. All in all, this was a fun experience but a stressful one. I probably will not be doing this again unless needed to or asked to.</p>

            <h2> Context</h2>
            <p>After learning the basics of cs50.dev and ide, students were tasked to create their own adventure.</p>
            <h2> Content</h2>
            <p> In this project, it is about solving a mystery. If you are interested, there is a link to the said project for you to play the project.</p>
            <h2> Challenges </h2>
            <p> One challenge was linking all of the files together. After all, sometimes it would not work well.</p>
            <p> Another challenge is what to write for certain scenerios. All scenes have to be unique. So no repition. Which is hard since when you're solving a mystery, you would have to reread all the evidence gathered.</p>

            <h2> Next Steps</h2>
            <p> I plan on making a better plan. After all, the plan in this project was quite messy. Which then made it confusing to read.</p>
